# VWA-template
A LaTeX template to be used at Austrian High School final projects.

# Requirements
You will need a biblatex file to be able to cite ressources. It is recommended to use Zotero and the Better-Biblatex-plugin to automatically keep your bibliography up-to-date.

# Citation style
This template uses the Chicago manual of style and uses new commands for analogous/literal citation. New citiation styles could be added with relatively little effort.
